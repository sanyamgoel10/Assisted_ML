# Assisted-ML
A NO CODE application which provides a user without any prior knowlegde of Machine Learning coding to automate his/her daily ML tasks by apply classical machine learning algorithms to any dataset. The application focuses on automatically detecting the columns and their datatypes and applies Supervised (Regression or Classification) or Unsupervised Learning algorithms on dataset based on data characterstics. Additionally, application allows user to predict future results from the applied ML model.<br><br>
The application automatically cleans the data as well, for example, handles NaN values present in dataset and removes any column acting as Primary Key for the dataset.<br>
Numerical and Categorical column types in dataset are automatically detected using some internal processes.<br><br>

For Clustering, K-Means Clustering is used.<br>
For Regression, Linear Regression is used.<br>
For Clustering, Decision Tree and SVM are used and results are shown for better accuracy providing algorithm.

## Steps to Run:
- Create a virtual environment for the project named venv
- Import all necesssary modules to venv
- Run the main.py file
- Automate your Machine Learning Journey!!
